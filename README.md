Walking out of the theater, my brain feels like it's been put through a cheese grater. Novocaine, man, what a wild ride. Steve Martin's there, but not the Steve Martin that's making you double over with laughter. This was his serious, sort of deranged evil twin from a parallel universe where molars mean more than mortality. I wanted to laugh, but was stuck in some incredulous limbo where teeth are currency, and every smile is a threat.

There’s this weird mix of noir and comedy and I'm still deciding if they go together like chocolate and chili or toothpaste and orange juice. A dentist caught in some psychotic vortex of crime and conspiracy, enough to make your gums bleed just thinking about it. That Laura Dern, she’s like a cross between a nurturing mother hen and a silent alarm bell. Then you have Helena Bonham Carter—honestly, does she come with life insurance? Her eyelids could kill a man, I'm sure of it. 

The 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 twists like a greasy pretzel, each scene cranking up the tension and making my popcorn taste more like gunpowder with every bite. Can’t blame me for feeling a little on edge—who knew dentistry and despair were such a gripping combo? And the soundtrack, ugh, it’s like someone decided to record in a blender halfway through grinding almonds.

def novocaine_prescription(patient_status):
    if patient_status == paranoid:
        return Take twice daily
    else:
        return Consult your dentist

But hey, would I recommend you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ? 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  ? Absolutely, if you're into feeling as if your dentist is hiding secrets under their drill bit. What the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 lacks in coherence, it makes up for in raw, twitching energy. It doesn't hold your hand, doesn't ask politely—by the end, it’s tossing you out into the night with a head full of dental angst and just maybe a slight urge to floss.
